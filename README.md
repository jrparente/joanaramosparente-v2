# Joana Ramos Parente Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The site is constantly evolving as I continue to add new features and updates.

## Quick Overview

This portfolio is built with a focus on modern web technologies and best practices. It leverages Vite for ultra-fast bundling and React for component-based architecture. The design is responsive and mobile-first, with a clean UI courtesy of Tailwind CSS.
